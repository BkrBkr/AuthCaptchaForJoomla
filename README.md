# JoomlaAuthCaptcha
This Joomla System Plugin adds a captcha challenge to all Joomla login-forms.

It works with the default Joomla login-component, the default Joomla login-module and the administrator page. Works with the recaptcha-plugins shipped by Google.
If you'd like to use other common login-components or other common captcha-plugins please feel free to open an issue. If you have problems with common templates please open an issue, too. (Only free and open source components, ...)
